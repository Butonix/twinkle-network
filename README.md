## Twinkle Website

Currently this is a small social media website used almost exclusively by students and teachers of Twinkle - an English teaching institute located in Seoul, Korea. The members of the website can share YouTube videos and educational web urls, create discussion topics, and chat inside channels or send private messages to other users.

Ultimately, I want this website to help children all around the world to:

- build relationships with students of different countries and culture early on in their lives
- find and connect with life long mentors from all over the world

- find motivation in learning, to become active learners instead of passive ones, to be driven by their own curiosity instead of the pressure put on to them by their parents.

- have opportunity to teach and help other children

- learn to discuss and debate

- have equal opportunity in both education and careers.

- have their minds filled with wonder

There's no fixed long term direction for this website other than the above mission. For the past one year since I started this project, all I focused on doing was to listen to my students and my fellow teachers' feedbacks and implementing what they wanted for this website. Now, my kids want to connect with people outside this country, and my primary focus at this point is to make that possible.
